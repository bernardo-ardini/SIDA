1st part:
-draw a realization of a gaussian process

2nd part:
- application of non parametric gaussian process 
- identify the inverse dynamic of a single link manipulator 

Forward dynamic:
apply a torque and then it correspond to a variation of angluar momentum \theta

find the inverse from theta learn the force.

Difficulty: we have three d vector theta, theta dot, theta double dot. INPUT LOCATION 

in class
g(u) = \bmatrix h(u(1)) & \vdots & h(u(N)) , h: \R \to \R and g: \R^n \to \R^n. 

and (\E[g(\sim{u})g(u)^T])_{ij} = \E[h(\sim{u}(t))h(u(s))] = \lambda e^{...}

here x \in \R^3 and h:\R^3\to \R. And g: M_{N,3} \to \R^N

(\E[g(\sim{u})g(u)^T])_{ij} = E[[h(\sim{u}(t))h(u(s))] = \lambda e^{-\frac{1}{2} \|x(t\|
